# Welcome to Functionize!

We offer onboarding and training for new users like you to learn Functionize through step-by-step User Guides available within our Functionize documentation.

The User Guides are designed to help you become active and productive on the Functionize platform as quickly as possible. Statistics show that taking ownership of your learning creates more internal motivation to learn!

You can find the Help documentation and our User Guides under your username at the top right of the screen after signing in.

## What to Expect

Our documentation includes the article **Functionize How-To Product Videos**, featuring links to multiple How-To videos on Functionize features. These videos provide tours of different functionalities and deeper dives into the how-to, where, and why of our product features. We encourage new users to watch and follow these instructive How-To videos to learn the Functionize platform.

Many of the How-To walkthroughs align with our documentation, tutorials, user guides, and other articles related to the topics being trained on. You can search for specific topics covered in the How-To videos in our Knowledge Center, which we continually strive to improve.

We greatly appreciate you, our new users, and hope your onboarding experience is both successful and positive. Your feedback is valuable to us, and we welcome any suggestions that help us better serve your business needs. If you need assistance at any time, please reach out to your Customer Success Manager or email us at [support@functionize.com](mailto:support@functionize.com).
